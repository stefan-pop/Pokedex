# Pokedex
**Desctiption**
* Small web application, made only with HTML, CSS and Javascript that loads data from an external API.

**How it works**
* The app loads data from an API into an unordered list.
* Each list item contains a name and a button to display more details in a modal.
* The user can filter the list by entering the name of the data in the input. The list will update automatically as the user types.

**Used API**
* [Pokemon -API](https://pokeapi.co/)

**Dependency**
* Bootstrap 5.0.0
* Since the app is using the last version of Bootstrap, Internet Explorer is not supported at all.
